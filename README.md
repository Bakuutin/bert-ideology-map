# I mapped 11,000 Reddit comments to see where they fall on a political & thinking-style map

![Political & Thinking-Style Map](plot.png)


- Each dot is a real comment from /r/politics.

- Left to right = how much the language sounds like Democrat vs Republican slogans.

- Bottom to top = how thoughtful or tribal the language is, inspired by “Low-Rung” vs “High-Rung” thinking from Wait But Why.

- 🟥 Red = language more like right-wing memes

- 🟦 Blue = language more like left-wing memes

- ⬆️ High-Rung = open-minded, curious, nuanced

- ⬇️ Low-Rung = black-and-white, us-vs-them, dogmatic
